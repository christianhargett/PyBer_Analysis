# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Project

### In this project we work for Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app. We have been tasked with performing an exploratory analysis on ride-sharing data. Once we perform our analysis we must create visualizations in order to tell a compelling story about the data. We will present these visualizations to the CEO.

### After performing our analysis and presenting our findings, the CEO has tasked us with an additional analysis. Our task is to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The CEO has also asked us to submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

### After merging all of our data and performing our calculations, we arrive at the below DataFrame:

### This DataFrame displays summary statistics for each city type in our dataset (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). The Total Rides and Total Drivers values from least to greatest are as follows: Rural, Suburban, Urban. This makes intuitive sense considering the general trend in population size for these city types follows the same pattern. The same applies for the Total Fares columns. It makes sense that Urban areas generate the most amount of fares considering this city type alone accounts for 68% of all of PyBer's rides.
